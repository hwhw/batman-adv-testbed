This will build a ready-to-run kernel plus initramfs (included into kernel image).

* adapt config if needed
* run prepare.sh
* run build.sh

that's it.

A wrapper script for QEmu to run the result is included in run.sh

You need a proper development environment, including
* gcc suite
* make
* git
* tar, xz
* probably tons of other stuff.

Kernel is built with the host compiler for now. That's likely to change to the toolchain used by buildroot in the future. Maybe.
